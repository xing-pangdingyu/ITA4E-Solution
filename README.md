# Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition - Solutions to Exercises and Problems

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide solutions to all exercises, problems, and some notes from *Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

By reading these exercises and answers, you will approach them with the perspective of an inquisitive and enthusiastic beginner, seeking to resolve uncertainties. There is no condescension toward simple questions from those with great knowledge, only a profound understanding of every detail, starting from the very beginning.

* Each chapter has its own directory.
* Each exercise solution is stored in a separate file within the corresponding chapter folder.
* Unless otherwise specified, each LaTex file can be compiled individually on your device without extra files.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xing-pangdingyu/ITA4E-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the chapter folder of interest:

   ```bash
   cd ITA4E-Solutions/Chapter_1
   ```
3. Open the **PDF** file (e.g., `C1_Solutions.pdf`) to view the solutions. Open LaTex file only if you want to review the code and comments.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **LaTex**
* **Linear Algebra**
* **Graph Theory**
* **Basic Analysis Skills**
