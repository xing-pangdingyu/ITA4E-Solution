# Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition - Solutions to Exercises and Problems

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide solutions to all exercises, problems, and some notes from *Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. This project aims to help learners understand the concepts by providing clear, well-documented solutions to the exercises in the textbook.

* Each chapter has its own directory.
* Each exercise solution is stored in a separate file within the corresponding chapter folder.
* Unless otherwise specified, each LaTex file can be compiled individually on your device without extra files.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xing-pangdingyu/ITA4E-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the chapter folder of interest:

   ```bash
   cd ITA4E-Solutions/Chapter_1
   ```
3. Open the **PDF** file (e.g., `C1_Solutions.pdf`) to view the solutions. Open LaTex file only if you want to review the code and comments.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **LaTex**
* **Linear Algebra**
* **Graph Theory**
* **Basic Analysis Skills**
