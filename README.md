# Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition - Solutions to Exercises

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide solutions to all exercises from *Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. This project aims to help learners understand the concepts by providing clear, well-documented solutions to the exercises in the textbook.

## Project Structure

```
Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Solutions/
├── Chapter-01/

```

* Each chapter has its own directory.
* Each exercise solution is stored in a separate file within the corresponding chapter folder.
* Unless otherwise specified, each LaTex file can be compiled individually on your device without extra files.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xing-pangdingyu/ITA4E-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the chapter folder of interest:

   ```bash
   cd ITA4E-Solutions/Chapter-01
   ```
3. Open any solution file (e.g., `exercise_1_1.tex`) and review the code and comments.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.X**
* **LaTex**
* **Linear Algebra**
* **Graph Theory**
